# 📚 Sujith's Library

Welcome to **Sujith's Library** — a personal, curated collection of notes, code examples, and key takeaways across programming languages, computer science concepts, and development tools.

> **⚠️ This project is no longer maintained.**
> 
> This site was originally built with Hugo and the Doks theme. While functional, it had limitations in customization, performance, and modern features. I've migrated to a new version using VitePress, which offers better maintainability, faster builds, and enhanced features like integrated diagrams and math rendering.

> *"Learning from top resources and courses often involves deep note-taking, practice, and learning from mistakes. This process led to this organized collection of key insights and summaries across different topics, to serve as a useful reference that’s easy to revisit in the future."*

## 🚀 About This Project

This is a growing knowledge base built while learning from top courses, tutorials, and hands-on experience. It’s designed to be a handy reference — structured, concise, and easy to revisit.

🧠 Built through:
- Focused note-taking during learning
- Hands-on coding and debugging
- Documenting key concepts, syntax, and common pitfalls

This site is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator, using the [Doks theme](https://getdoks.org/) for a clean, documentation-style layout with search functionality.

## 🗂️ Sujith's Library Catalog

To help organize and navigate the growing list of topics, I've built a **wrapper site** —  
🔗 [**Sujith's Library Catalog**](https://sujith-eag.github.io/library/)
This serves as the main entry point to explore all topics in a structured and categorized manner.
